This is the framework of my personal/ professional site.

Current code is commented out for later use and development.

Website is built on framework from developer listed below. All credit to it's appropriate owners.

Website is deployed on github.io

Changes to be made in the coming months:
- adding more personal and professional photos (i.e. headshots/ screenshots of web apps)
- fleshing out contact form for freelance working
- reworking Index page "about me" and "work experience" pages
- reference pages

A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

(* = Not included)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
