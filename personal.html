						<h3>Nashville's Music Scene</h3>
						<p>
							Graduating from Belmont University was a bitter sweet moment. Having majored in Audio Engineering Technology and minored in Music Business, I had spent years jumping from one event to the next.
							From stage hand, to technician, production assistant, and even a few supervisor roles, I experienced all I could throughout the city, but I decided to build my future at an touring equipment rental shop.
							For two years, I fixed, maintained, and cleaned equipment  while I was home, and spent the rest of my time out on assignment, working backstage on tours and events, even a few cruise ships.
							I got a first hand taste of the joys of being apart of a small team, and seeing people laugh and make memories

								<h3>A Changing World</h3>
								<p>
									After March of 2020, it was time to focus less on helping others and more on helping myself. I spent the year exploring my interest and developed a love of technology.
									I started to teach myself basic coding skills and eventually found my way into an up-skilling program based around IT fundamentals. 
									Three months of studying and growing helped me land my first role as a Help Desk Agent. However, web development was still at the front of my mind. 
									That's where the Nashville Software School came into play. I enrolled in their full time web development program in early 2021 and it's been a rollercoaster ever since.

								<h3>You Never Stop Learning</h3>
								<p>
									I fully believe the old axiom "You are never done learning," which is why I love the path I find myself on.
									Web Development, much like Live Events, is never the same day to day, which presents countless opportunities to advance and grow.
									I am excited to tackle all that life has to offer, both in my first career path of Live Events and in my newest home of Software Development.
